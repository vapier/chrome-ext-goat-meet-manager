# GOAT Meet Manager

A small extension to expose Google Meet controls outside of its own tab.

This makes it easy to refer to documentation in other tabs or windows during a
meeting and not worry about having to find the right tab when someone calls on
you specifically.
Now you can toggle the mute settings from anywhere, or quickly focus the active
meeting no matter which window it's in.

## Features

- No ads, user tracking, stats gathering, or any other nonsense.
- Automatically unloads when not in use.
- Easy browser button to toggle settings.
- Custom keyboard shortcuts to control actions.
- Autofocus the meeting when toggling status.
- Mute audio or video by default when connecting to meetings.
